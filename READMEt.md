# GTM-API-Automation

Using the GTM API to read a GTM container implemented on a global Ecommerce site and implement the assets necessary to accomodate a Consent Management Tool (CMT).

This creates all GTM assets necessary to leverage the CMT events onsite, and refine all existing GTM triggers to accomodate the CMT logic.
